	<p>At St Bakhita we have a variety <br> of annual events. The events form an excellent platform where  <br>parents show up and give  <br>unwavering moral support to their <br>children as they watch them perform different activities. <br> This is very salient as learners  <br> appreciate the role of parents in their academic life both in and out of class.The events include: <br>
Sports day, Cultural day, Music concerts, <br> Christmas concert, Easter celebrations, <br> Swimming gala Talent day and <br> Kindergarten graduation</p>

	<h1> Head teacher Comments</h1>
	<p>Our nursing department provides a good  <br>health monitor for children. Young  <br>children encounter various health <br> challenges as their immunity develops. <br> This calls for frequent monitoring and this <br> is where the residential nurse comes  <br>in handy. Parents receive real time <br> update on the health progress of their <br> learners from this desk.</p>
